# RobotSoccer
This project was developed to get a bachelors degree in Control and Automation Engineer. This project is game soccer based, whom use Multi-agent System to control the teams. The blue team agents use the reinforced learning (Q-Learning) to learn to play, and, red team is formed by pure react agents which have states and actions predefined. It have a own physics engine, which works using some laws of kinetics physic to provide the reaction between interactions of the bodies. The environment was developed using the model-view-control project patern, the observer project patter and a free library to control the sprites. All graphics were designed by myself.
